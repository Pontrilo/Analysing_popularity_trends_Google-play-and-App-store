# Analysing_popularity_trends_Google-play-and-App-store

## App Store and Google Play profitable App profiling summary
Working for a company that builds Android and iOS mobile apps that are available on the Google Play and App store, for this project we are going to be comparing App profiles. The solutions will help developers make better decisions on how to design and update their apps.

The apps designed by the company are all free to download and install so all revenue comes from Ads. As revenue for adverts comes from in app views of the advert we are going to be comparing frequency data so developers can identify which apps are more attractive to their customer base.

*A guided project with Dataquest to analyse popularity trends amongst apps in the Google Play and App store.*
